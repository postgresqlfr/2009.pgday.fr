====== About PGDay ======


The European PostgreSQL Day (aka PGDday) is a day of celebration. Celebration for PostgreSQL and, on a wider view, for the free software and open-source communities based in Europe.

The event will take place in Paris, France on November 6 and 7 2009. PostgreSQL is an open-source project for object-relational database management that was started on the 8th of July 1986, at the University of California, Berkeley.

The PGDay 2009 is a chance for French and European users and developers of PostgreSQL to catch up, learn, build relationships, get to know each other and consolidate a real network of professionals that use this outstanding product for the daily management of relational and object databases.

Another fundamental goal for the event, is to promote the usage of PostgreSQL as a completely free tool for database management, a very competitive alternative to proprietary solutions.

Among the others, the most suitable audiences for the event (and the most suitable targets for PostgreSQL usage as well) are

    * government organizations
    * schools and universities 
    * small and middle size companies

PGDay is organised as a set of parallel talks, seminars, presentations, tutorials and practical workshops that will run throughout the day. Based on the target and the level of knowledge of the product, the happenings will be divided into:

    * advanced technical level presentations
    * basic technical level and use-case presentations
