===== ORMs: Strengths, Weaknesses, and Building a PostgreSQL-specific ORM =====

Object-relational mappers (ORMs) have become exceedingly popular tools to access relational databases, as they provide convenient interfaces for software developers to write code in their preferred programming language with little to no use of SQL.

This talk will give examples of open-source ORMs, such as ActiveRecord and SQLAlchemy, and review strengths and weaknesses of ORM design and ways we can improve upon it.
