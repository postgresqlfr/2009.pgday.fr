The location of all these hotels are available on [[http://tinyurl.com/hotelspgday2009|This map]]



Paris Marriott Rive Gauche Hotel is really close to the conference location, but this is a rather expensive hotel (200+ euros per night).




The Kyriad Hotel, in Porte d'Ivry, has special rates (see //How To Book// at bottom of the page) :

  * room for one person (per night): 68 euros;
  * room for two persons (per night): 82 euros;
  * room for three persons (per night): 102 euros.
//Breakfast and wifi internet access are included in this rate.//



Note that two of the hotels are outside the city of Paris. You should remember this if you want to enjoy Paris' nightlife, as cab drivers usually don't like to go outside of Paris after 10 PM. These hotels still have good public transportation to the conference area during most hours - trains and metro runs from 6AM to 12PM.


There are also a number of other hotels in the general area available from regular travel booking sites. They usually have only a few rooms available and no special rates for us. If you look there, we recommend you look in the general areas of //Place d'Italie// or //Montparnasse//.

We recommend that you book your room **as soon as possible**. November is a period full of events in Paris. Hotels are full really early, so don't wait to get a room.
