===== Writeable CTEs: The Next Big Thing =====

  In the SQL standard, Common Table Expressions (CTEs) are a way of
creating and using views at run time, but only in read queries.  Here
we create ways to use them in writes.  We plan to make all parts of
CTEs writeable, starting with the insides of the CTEs as in,

    WITH t AS (DELETE FROM foo RETURNING *) ...

We also plan to make the outside of the table expression writeable, as
in:

    WITH t AS (SELECT ....) INSERT INTO foo...
    WITH t AS (SELECT ....) UPDATE foo...
    WITH t AS (SELECT ....) DELETE FROM foo...

Further plans include making the writeable CTEs recursive.  This is
still in the design stage.
