Some companies may wish to independently sponsor one or more speakers to come to the European PGDay 2009 by paying for their travel directly. The speaker and the sponsor need to officially inform PGFR or PGEU about this private agreement if they intend to be acknowledged. However, if companies prefer to sponsor a speaker through the non profit organisation,  PGFR or PGEU is happy to accommodate that request.
